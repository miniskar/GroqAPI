    "1. First, we need to make a copy of our input matrix in order to do X*X. We'll use our learnings from the Memory Copy Tutorial to do this, however we'll include it inside a buffered resource scope. Doing a memory copy from within the GroqChip reduces the data being sent via the PCIe bus thereby reducing bloat on the bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now that we have two sets of 'x', we can multiply them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Since the result of the matrix multiply is float32, we need to cast it to float16 before the second matrix multiply.\n",
