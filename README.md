# GroqAPI

Welcome to Groq's API repository! Groq API is a direct hardware embedded domain specific language, offering you the ability to hand code
your compute to target Groq's architecture. If you’re trying to decide which tool to use, Groq API allows for fine grained control
of the GroqChip™ processor enabling the development of custom applications and maximizing the performance possible.
